# Livecountsedit
This repository contains the unminified source code for all versions of Livecountsedit made by RandomPerson3465.

[Livecountsedit](https://randomperson3465.github.io/livecountsedit) is a fake "live subscriber counter" that you can customize to make it appear as if a channel has a certain number of subscribers. The CSS for Livecountsedit is mostly borrowed from [livecounts.net](https://livecounts.net), which is the site that Livecountsedit is based off of. The idea for Livecountsedit came from RandomPerson3465's most viewed video in 2019, which was a clip of Socialblade being modified to appear as if T-Series lost all of their subscribers.

Fun fact: The [livecounts.net](https://livecounts.net) site [had a fake subscriber count feature](https://twitter.com/LivecountsSite/status/848275500749299712) as an April Fools' joke back in 2017.

There might be a new update for Livecountsedit soon, despite RandomPerson3465 saying he didn't want to work on it anymore in September 2021.

This update will:
- Merge the code for compare mode and regular mode, so they have the same features and are updated at the same time.
- Currently, it is planned to have the old Livecounts.net theme, but there might be settings to customize the theme.
- Introduce a better settings menu
- Add a "custom distribution" feature to replace the "Occasionally remove subs" in v3

Planned ideas (note that NONE of these are confirmed and they might not appear at all in the update):
- Feature to import and export settings/themes (kind of like the URL parameters in v4)
- Adding a channel banner and icon (will be optional, as the basic layout of Livecounts.net doesn't have those)
- Ability to resize and move the graph, channel banner, and channel icon
- ???
