# Livecountsedit
This repository contains the unminified source code for all versions of Livecountsedit made by RandomPerson3465.

[Livecountsedit](https://randomperson3465.github.io/livecountsedit) is a fake "live subscriber counter" that you can customize to make it appear as if a channel has a certain number of subscribers. The CSS for Livecountsedit is mostly borrowed from [livecounts.net](https://livecounts.net), which is the site that Livecountsedit is based off of. The idea for Livecountsedit came from RandomPerson3465's most viewed video in 2019, which was a clip of Socialblade being modified to appear as if T-Series lost all of their subscribers.

Fun fact: The [livecounts.net](https://livecounts.net) site [had a fake subscriber count feature](https://twitter.com/LivecountsSite/status/848275500749299712) as an April Fools' joke back in 2017.
